# SticsOnR 1.3.0 _2025-03-18_

MAIN CHANGES:
  * Taking into account latest STICS changes (v10.3.0): copy snow state variables when needed
  * Deactivation of parallel execution in the stics wrapper function for 1 USM    
    and core number limitation to USMs number
  * Taking onto account the Dominance column for inter-crops
  * Warnings: 
     * when no results are returnes when sit_var_dates_mask empty but not null
     * param_values which are not effective for inter-crops


FIXES:
  * Bug in run_system called by run_stics
  * Code styling
  * Getting STICS version string from the command line return (linked to STICS changes)
  * Removal of 0 values for phenological stages must be done before date selection
  

# SticsOnR 1.2.0 _2024-02-22_

MAIN CHANGES:
  * parallelization in the wrapper is now optional (cluster deactivation)
  * README update with latest JavaStics/STICS versions and information     
  about executable installation on MacOS systems 


FIXES:
  * tidyr package was missing in imports
  * checking if the JavaStics folder is given when forcing parameters values
    in the wrapper
  * for several years simulations, the wrapper now is returning specific values
    for stages for each year, not the same one for all the years
  * limitation of sub-dirs discovering (recursivity deactivated) in the 
    workspace for the run_system function

# SticsOnR 1.1.0 _2023-07-12_

MAIN CHANGES:
  * Added a valid license (LGPL)
  * According to SticsRFiles changes 
  * Using CRAN SticsRFiles package (1.1.3)

FIXES:
  * Removed useless functions provided by SticsRFiles 1.1.3
  * Removed useless files and function documentation
  * linting issues


# SticsOnR 1.0.1  _2023-01-03_

* Fixed cff file generation using github action. Now generated on each commit that modifies the Description file + on release.
* Minor changes following CRAN checks procedure application.

# SticsOnR 1.0.0  _2022-07-22_

MAIN CHANGES:
  * run_javastics: new argument for giving the path of the java version to use
  * stics_wrapper: 
    * set "variete" to be forced first if included in param_values argument (so that varietal parameters are well handled if included in param_values)
    * using () in names of variables (var argument) is now taken into account
  * homogenization of argument names between functions
  * some functions moved to the SticsRFiles package
  * simulated phenological stages now take the same value of julian day whatever the date is

FIXES:
  * stics_wrapper: run successive USMs did not work in case required variables (var argument) were not defined in var.mod
  * run_stics: running automatically usms stored in subdirectories of workspace did not work
  * run_javastics: 
    * STICS execution errors now captured
    * relative path of workspace now correctly taken into account
  
  

# SticsOnR 0.2.2  _2021-06-17_

## Changes

* Improved the way stics output files are read in stics_wrapper
* Minor change in run_javastics and stics_wrapper doc
* FIX: on.exit was badly placed in stics_wrapper, sometimes lead to ugly error messages.

# SticsOnR 0.2.1 _2021-03-12_

## General changes

* A few bugs fixed 

## Specific changes

R/run_system_cmd.R
 * FIX: relative path for stics executable were not well handled
 
R/stics_wrapper.R
 * FIX: situation was not correctly spelled in doc ... (2021-02-24)
 * FIX: incorrect test on param_values in case parameters take different values for different USMs (2021-02-24)
 * FIX: searching if the OS specific stics fortran exe name exists in the preference.xml file (whole word search) (2021-02-12)
 * FIX: force_param_values removed from .export (already exported in the foreach loop, this generated a warning) (2021-02-02)
 * FIX: Fail proofing check_java_workspace + add winslash = "/" to all normalizePath for consistency (2021-01-21)
 * FIX: exe check crashed when only Stics exe was given => test is deactivated
 
R/stics_exe_utilities.R
 * FIX: better handling of workspace sub-folders list for identifying available situations to simulate

# SticsOnR 0.2.0 _2021-01-15_

## General changes

* DESCRIPTION
  * license changed to License for CeCILL-C

* README: fix stics_wrapper examples and new ones added

* Automatic testing: 
  * Travis checks removed
  * Github Actions added for checks
  * SticsRTest Travis tests triggering removed
  
* Documentation
  * vignettes : updates according to functions changes, completion
  * functions help: content fixes, examples, setting examples to dontrun, ...
  
* fix: CRAN issues for checks

## Specific changes

* stics_wrapper: using force_param_values, keeping Plant column if exists, added some functions export in foreach loop, get_daily_results call updated according to SticsRFiles changes, added cropr_simulation class attribute, taking into account successives simulations, interface changes, changes about output structure format and way of handling dates and variables changed, added selection of results using sit_names and sit_var_dates_mask, fix error treatment for all simulations failing case, output content fixed in case of errors, added case when using only javastics_path for fixing Stics executable file (whithout knowing its version), passing libpath to workers (run on clusters), re-run when missing output variables (after adding them to the var.mod)
